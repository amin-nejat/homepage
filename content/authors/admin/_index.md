I am a graduate student of theoretical neuroscience at Columbia University. My research interests are quite broad, but I am mostly interested in modeling real-world physical data using tools and techniques from optimization, probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and dynamical systems. Apart from my academic life, I'm very much into sports and dancing. I play soccer and basketball very often and I sometimes swim, bike and run. I'm currently learning ballroom and latin dance and I'm part of a Persian dance group called GISU.

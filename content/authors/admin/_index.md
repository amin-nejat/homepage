I'm a postdoc at NYU and the Flatiron Institute working with <a href="http://neurostatslab.org/">Alex Williams</a>. My research interests are quite broad, but I am mostly interested in modeling neural data using tools and techniques from statistics, machine learning, and dynamical systems. I did my PhD in the <a href="https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/">Center for Theoretical Neuroscience</a> of Columbia University where I was primarily advised by <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/">Liam Paninski</a>. Apart from my academic life, I'm very much into sports and dancing. I often play soccer and basketball and I occasionally swim, bike and run. I'm currently learning ballroom and latin dances and I'm part of a Persian dance group called GISU.

While the structure and dynamics of spiking neural networks (SNNs) may increase their computational power compared to traditional neural networks, the complexity of such networks is the main reason that they are less being used in the implementation of real intelligent systems in the field of artificial intelligence. On the other hand, the nervous system of animals have been evolved in such a way that they can solve hard problems easily such as the problem of voice recognition. In this project, I proposed a new approach based on the structure and mechanisms of the rat's auditory system to implement a SNN for the problem of voice recognition.

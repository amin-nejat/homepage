The RoboCup 3D Simulated Soccer League allows software agents to control humanoid robots to compete against one another in a realistic simulation of the rules and physics of a game of soccer. Our team was called Paaydar and together with M. Razeghi, E. Tavakkoli and A. Arabzadeh we implemented all the codes in C++ using KDL library.

This project is a hotel reservations system. Users are either hotel managers or normal users. Hotel managers can add/edit/delete hotels or rooms through their account. Normal users are able to search for rooms specifying required information. I also added a recommender system using collaborative filtering algorithm. Project for Systems Analysis and Design course done with A. Rostami and S. Masoudian. Implemented in Python using django framework for the server side.

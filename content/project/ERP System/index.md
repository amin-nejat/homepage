In this project, we followed Unified Process methodology and developed an object oriented ERP system. We extracted use cases based on a set of customer requirements and prepared deliverables based on those use cases. Deliverables are use case diagrams, activity diagrams, CRC cards, analysis class diagram, analysis package diagram, analysis sequence diagrams, design class diagram, design package diagram, design sequence diagrams, component diagram, database schema, deployment diagram, server software, client software, installation guide, and user manual. Project for Object Oriented Design course done with M. Shafiei and E. Imani. Diagrams were drawn using UML, database was implemented using SQL, and the software was implemented in java.

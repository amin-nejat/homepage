In this research, we are trying to find evidence that the brain encodes information about uncertainty, risk, and reward. We also want to know how different types of attention proposed by Professor J. Gottlieb (attention for action, attention for learning, and attention for reward)<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312008884"></a> play role in decision making and how do uncertainty and reward compete for attention in different task contexts? The research is sponsored by Columbia University and investigated by Professor J. Gottlieb. The data collection is done at Professor J. Gottlieb's lab by Dr N. Foley. Our team in brain engineering center at IPM (V. Davoodnia, H. Rahimi Nasrabadi, E. Zabeh and I) is mainly responsible for behavioral and neural data analysis.

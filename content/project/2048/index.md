We developed this system based on a huristic funtion that maps each state of 2048 game into a real number. To reduce time complexity, we used alpha/beta algorithm to prune state space graph. Together with  M. Chavoshian we did this project as the course project for Artificial Intelligence course. All the codes are in prolog programming language.

In this project, an image feature extraction system is developed to convert texture, color and gradient of images into feature vectors. I implemented LDA to reduce feature space dimension and both SVM and KNN methods for classifying images. Also I implemented different evalution methods to compare two classification methods. Project for Machine Learning course. Implemented in Matlab using image processing and machine learning toolboxes.

abstract: The degree of coordination between simultaneous activities of two different nodes is a fundamental property of network dynamics and, by definition, it must be computed on data from two network nodes that have been observed simultaneously. In neuroscience, however, simultaneous measurements of the dynamical variables of interest are often not available. Here we consider the scenario where a direct estimate of correlations is therefore not possible. Nonetheless, we show that correlations between the activity of two cells can be reliably estimated using information from a cue cell simultaneously observed with both. We discuss how delay-embedding principles can be used to solve the problem, we test the proposed technique on pseudo-data from chaotic models, we then apply it to a sizeable archival dataset, and we show that the proposed method reliably outperforms naive linear approaches. Previously proposed techniques to face the same problem demand the availability of a large population of simultaneously measured channels or make assumptions about the generative process of the data. By contrast, we show that our method requires information from a single cue channel and makes minimal assumptions about the underlying dynamics. Besides, we provide guidelines to make suitable choices for the cue cell out of the observed set. Besides introducing a novel tool for data analysis, our results provide corroboration on the relevance of attractor reconstruction to neural data.
